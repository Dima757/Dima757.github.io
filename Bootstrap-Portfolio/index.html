                <p>I am a hard working and ambitious web developer. Some of my best qualites are creativity, precision, and
                    quality of content. I try to put my best foot forward on all projects and am highly competetive when
                    asked to do an assignment.

                    <br>
                    <br> During these next six months I will be asked to do several challenging tasks that might make me
                    want to give up and quit. However, I know that deep down insde there is no quit for me at this point
                    and I am ready to take everything that is given to me head on and I am sure I will survive and succeed.

                    <br>
                    <br> The hardest part of this whole assignment is getting off a good base and having the proper building
                    blocks on top of everything. One false move can mess up your whole page and make you have to go back
                    and do everything all over again. This is very scary to me but at the same time I understand how important
                    trail and error are in the learning process so therefore I am appecting of such trials and tribulations
                    ahead of me.</P>
